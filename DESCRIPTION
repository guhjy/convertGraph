Description: The 'convertGraphic' package converts graphical file formats (SVG,
    PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, PDF, etc) to one another. The exceptions are the
    SVG file format that can only be converted to other formats and in contrast,
    PDF format, which can be created from others graphical formats.
    The package provides a solution for converting SVG file format to PNG which
    is often needed for exporting graphical files produced by R widgets.
