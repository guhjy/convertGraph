# convertGraph
#### An R package for converting graphical files to one another


There are plenty of widgets available for R that produce and export graphical files, often in SVG format. 
There is a clear demand for a package to **dynamicaly** convert these file formats to one another, with a high quality. 
For example, to export SVG file to PNG, PDF, JPEG, or GIF with a customized resolution. Or export a PNG file to PDF or 
JPEG, etc. 

The `convertGraph` package provides a solution for that. It **does not require RStudio** and is fully functional within R. 
In addition, it allows you to increase the resolution of exported file. 

`convertGraph` is hosted on CRAN and can be installed by :

> `install.packages("convertGraph")`
